# Cooky
A simple project where I can practice my skills and learn new ones!


## What is this all about?

Cookies! We all love some good cookies, and this project's main focus 
is on the creation, storage and consumption of cookies.

There exist three types of cookies: Chocolate, Raisin and Cream. Each 
of these cookies has a specific way of being of being rated, which 
affects how much the cookie eating creatures will enjoy consuming them.

The previously mentioned creatures can either be Ogres, Cyclops or 
Trolls, with each of them loving, hating or being indiferent to each 
type of cookie.

## The technologies 

The technologies that will be used for this concept are:

. C# with .NET Core 6
. OpenTelemetry & Jaeger to trace information
. Kafka to produce and consume information regarding the position of 
    each creature on their respective cookie packages
. Prometheus and Grafana to capture metrics
